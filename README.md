# James' Frontend Learning
I have not touched the frontend since the olden days when jquery was popular, 
ES6 was still experimental and it was still a pretty good idea to use
underscore and backbone as a web framework. This project contains my refresher
course on getting familiar with modern frontend web development again. I'll 
update this regularly with the tutorials and code katas that I work through. 


## Practice
My current plan is to kind of iterate over the different aspects and concepts 
within React, Yarn aand Next.js and kind of do a daily kata practcing each. The
list below is the topics I plan to go over to get familiar and up to speed, with
links to the tutorials and docs for those who want to follow along.

### React
* [x] [Intro to React](tutorial-1/README.md)
* [ ] [Testing Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html)

### NextJS
* [ ] [Basic NextJS Application](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
* [ ] [AWS Serverless NextJS](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-nextjs)
