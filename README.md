# James' Frontend Learning
I have not touched the frontend since the olden days when jquery was popular, 
ES6 was still experimental and it was still considered a swell idea to use
[underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and [backbone](https://backbonejs.org/) 
for all the frontend things. This project contains my refresher
course on getting familiar with modern frontend web development again. 

Why? I am a big believer that an effective engineer can seamlessly criss-cross
all levels of the stack from the frontend to the backend to even the infrastruture
the application runs on. Plus for me personally, I'm looking to get back to being 
a builder because I draw great energy from the things I create.

So stay tuned, I'll update this regularly with the tutorials and code katas that I work through. 


## Practice
My current plan is to kind of iterate over the different aspects and concepts 
within React, Yarn aand Next.js and kind of do a daily kata practcing each. The
list below is the topics I plan to go over to get familiar and up to speed, with
links to the tutorials and docs for those who want to follow along.
